/* Codtitions
1) The dates supported in the calendar system are from May 9, 2022 to Aug 8, 2022, 
2) No appointment can be made on weekends and holidays.
3) The time format for each day is using the 24-hour format, from 0:00 to 24:00. We only care
about the hour and minute field and ignore the second field.
4) An appointment in the calendar system can only be made at multiples of 30 minutes, and
it only supports the same day appointment. For example, May 9th 9:00 to 9:30 appointment
is valid, May 9th 10:00 to 12:30 is also valid, May 9th 10:10 to 10:30 is invalid because
10:10 is not a multiple of 30 minutes, May 9th 19:00 to May 10th 9:00 is invalid because it
crosses two days
